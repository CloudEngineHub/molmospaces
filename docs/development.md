## Install dependencies

The most up-to-date setup uses the `uv` package manger, but conda should work
file as well. Unfortunately the `bpy` package (used for generating houses) is no
longer available in PyPi for the Python version that we currently target (`3.10`),
so we have to manually install it as first step, like this:

```bash
# If using conda as package manager, just use plain `pip`
pip install bpy==3.6.0 --extra-index-url https://download.blender.org/pypi/
# If using uv as package manager, use `uv pip` instead
uv pip install bpy==3.6.0 --extra-index-url https://download.blender.org/pypi/
```

After this, we can install all other dependencies along with the `molmo_spaces`
package using the provided `pyproject.toml`, like this:

```bash
# If using conda as package manager, just use plain `pip`
pip install -e .
# If using uv as package manager, use `uv pip` instead
uv pip install -e .
```

**Note**: For development purposes, you can install the extra dev packages:

```bash
# If using conda as package manager, just use plain `pip`
pip install -e . --group dev
# If using uv as package manager, use `uv pip` instead
uv pip install -e . --group dev
```

## Configure development setup

After you have installed the dependencies in the `dev` group, we have to setup
`pre-commit` and the related hooks so these can run when doing a commit to the
repository. Just run the following to install the hooks:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

After this, you can run `pre-commit run` on your local changes that are staged,
it should show something like this:

![pre-commit example][img-doc-pre-commit-example-1]

In this case the hooks catched an issue with the line ending of the `requirements.txt`
file, it complains that files should have an empty line at the end (we could disable
this hook if it's too annoying :sweat_smile:). Note that no Python files were
staged, so the hooks for `ruff` and `mypy` didn't run. For more info on how
to use `pre-commit` check [this][0] video, and the [docs][1].

**Note**: In very extreme cases, you might need to skip running the hooks, for
example, if the checks are not configured correctly and running on all files (for
now it should only run on staged files only). To skip the checks, just run your
commit with the `--no-verify` flag. Just keep in mind that the CI/CD pipeline
will catch these issues in the future once enabled, currently it's using `black`
to check only for formatting, but in the next PR will change this to use `ruff`
for formating and linting, and `mypy` for type checking.

## Updating the linting rules

If you want to enable/disable a linting rule for ruff, you can do so by modifying
the corresponding section on the `pyproject.toml` file. For example, to enable a whole
set of linting checks, you could change this section:

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [
    # docstring
    "D",
    # pycodestyle
    "E",
    # Pyflakes
    "F",
    # pyupgrade
    "UP",
    # flake8-bugbear
    "B",
    # flake8-simplify
    "SIM",
    # isort
    "I",
    # PEP8
    "W",
    # flake8-annotations
    "ANN",
]
```

The rules identifiers can be found [here][2], so you can add extra rules if you
want :smiley:. To disable specific linting checks from ruff, you can add the
corresponding rule id to the ignore list in the same section of the `pyproject.toml`
file, like this (add to the `ignore` list of rule ids):

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [
    # ...
]
ignore = [
    "C408", # don't complain about usage of dict() calls
    "C901", # don't complain about function complexity
    "E501", # don't complain about line-length (handled by line-length setting)
    "B006", # defaults shouldn't be mutable
    "UP015", # redundant mode arguments in open should be fine for now
    "SIM117", # allow nested with statements for now
    "SIM102", # don't be picky about nested if statements
    "SIM114", # don't be picky about merging if branches using or
]
```

You can get the id of the rule you want to disable by checking on the warning
given by your IDE. If you're using `vscode`, just hover over the warning message
and you can grab the rule ID for that lint check.

## Setting up IDE (e.g. `vscode`)

For formatting and linting you might want to install the `ruff` vscode extension:

![ruff-vscode-extension][img-docs-ruff-vscode-extension]

To set it up, just add this to your user settings (change `formatOnSave` to your
desired setting):

```json
    "[python]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": false,
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
    },
```
